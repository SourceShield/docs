# Getting Started

## What is SourceShield?
[SourceShield](https://sourceshield.io) is a software supply chain security platform that integrates directly into build and deploy tooling to detect security risks and enforce supply chain best practices. SourceShield is installed as a GitHub Application, which is the sole interface for interacting with the platform. There are no SaaS dashboards, logins, APIs, or other sites that you, or your organization's developers, need to manage.

## What does SourceShield do?
SourceShield secures your build and deploy environments by surfacing potential supply chain security risks, enforcing best practices, and gently nudging your developers to adopt better security practices.

There are three main components of SourceShield:
1. PR Review and Enforcement
    a. aa
2. SourceShield Commands
3. Real-Time Event Monitoring
