# FAQ

## Q. What are the requirements to use SourceShield?
SourceShield works on any GitHub account or organization (although it does not currently support GitHub Enterprise). It can be configured to run on any public repository. Private repository support is limited to specific design partners as we continue building out additional functionality (if interested, please click [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeHOxckS_aCSu5rzsYHVTrEEjInfNcTAngzZF2BwDAozb7RpQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)).

## Q. What should I expect while SourceShield is in beta?
SourceShield is under active development. While in beta, features may change, or be removed. We may add or remove permissions, which may require updates to your GitHub application installation. You may encounter bugs. We encourage you to [file](https://github.com/SourceShield/support/issues/new/choose) bug reports and feature requests.

## Q. How much will SourceShield cost?
We're not sure yet. However, the current plan is to make most features of SourceShield free for public (open source) repositories while requiring a paid plan for usage on private repositories. When our pricing model is finalized, it will be transparent and public on our website and subscribing will not require any calls with a sales team.
