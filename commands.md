# Commands
{: .no_toc }

SourceShield slash commands (`/sourceshield`) enable additional SourceShield functionality on GitHub pull requests and issues. For example, you can ask SourceShield to generate a security report containing details about the author of a pull request that might contain helpful context for pull request reviewers.

## Setting up Commands
{: .no_toc }

SourceShield commands do not require any additional setup beyond ensuring the `.github/sourceshield.yml` file is committed to the repository's main branch. To invoke a command, simply leave a comment on a pull request or issue with the `/sourceshield` keyword, followed by the command name.
